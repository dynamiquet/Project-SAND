### Team Goal Statement

In coming together to discuss our tentative plans for the group project, we discovered a shared drive to improve our software development skills, among other things. Specifically, our team hopes to further develop the following skills:
- Effective use of Git and GitHub both in and outside of a group project
- Building database-driven websites
- Creating code that is well-written, well-documented, and maintainable
- Application of ethical reasoning to the software development process
- Producing accessible and intuitive software
- Enhancing teamwork and communication to foster collaboration and efficient problem-solving
- Applying Agile practices to boost team efficiency and trust

We hope this course project marks the beginning or continuation of our journey to becoming successful software or general developers with a strong focus on efficiency, style, and ethics.

In short, our team goal is as follows:
> As a team, (AJ)^2 strives to produce exemplary work by adhering to Agile practices, fostering a healthy work environment, and promoting collective skill development among its members.

### Capitilizing on Team Strengths

WIP dependent on group opinion and strengths
>Think about your team goals and how each person might contribute to achieving them based on their strengths. Does assigning roles make sense for your team, or perhaps rotating roles? Note that exact roles and responsibilities will likely change over the lifetime of this project, and that’s ok. Is someone in charge of setting meetings? Two people focused on reviewing code or testing?

### Team Expectations

Our team will be guided by the following expectations to ensure the production of our software is efficient while maintaining group trust:

##### Meetings:
Our team will meet... set time, date, place, and duration
##### Roles:
In team meetings, we will have the following roles: discuss roles
Roles will be rotated every two weeks to ensure every team member has experience in all roles and that work is delegated evenly.

**Who is responsible for setting agendas, taking notes, facilitating discussions, etc?**
##### Communication:
Communication will remain constant through the use of a groupchat with all team members on Whatsapp. Questions, concerns, and updates can be made through text if not all members are present in person. Work, specifically code, will be shared and pushed to the group Github repository frequently, with comments, to ensure teammates have access to the most up-to-date work.

Trust and respect among team members is highly valued in our team. Respect within the purposes of our group and our goal statement can be defined as:
> Respect is the recognition of each person's inherent worth, perspectives, and contributions. It involves treating others with kindness, fairness, and dignity, regardless of differences in opinions, backgrounds, or experiences.

We plan to adhere to this definition by being active listeners, inclusive teammates, and understanding individuals

Teammates should check-in with updates to their progress on individual or group tasks by both pushing updated code to Github and messaging the groupchat about the progress. If progress/task involves little code, a short description of work done can be expressed during group meeting. Check-ins need not be daily, but tasks should be done by agreed upon due dates with reasonable progress updates.

If a teammate is not communicating, a member of the group will reach out to said teammate and ask if everything is okay on their end. Guilt and blame will never be the intention of check-ins, but instead reaching out will serve as an opportunity for both parties to express potential concerns and questions. If the teammate cannot be reached or continues to not communicate, the group will reach out to Professor Jean Salac about concerns and further steps.
##### Technologies: 
All notes taken during a group meeting will be shared in a Google Drive for all team members to access. If a meeting is not in-person, a virtual meeting will be held over Google Meets or Zoom.
##### Decision-Making:
Major decisions (such as significantly huge changes to features in the project) or any decisions requiring group input will only be made if all group members agree.
##### Delegation:
The division of work will be decided based on team strengths and willingess to take on tasks. More stuff
>How will you ensure that everybody participates meaningfully? How will you make sure that everyone’s contribution is valued?
##### Conflict Resolution:
Satisfactory participation requires that all team members complete their given tasks by the assigned due date, with progress check-ins made as frequently as possible. If a task cannot be completed by the assigned due date, communication with the group must be made as soon as possible. Tasks need not be done completely alone, questions and calls for help can and are encouraged to be made to the group.

If a team member does not live up to their responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team, the following process will be made.
1. A team member or the group will reach out to the team member and express concerns about lack of participation. Discussions must remain respectful as defined in this contract.
   1. The discussion will allow for the contacted team member to express any difficulties with meeting responsibilities or understanding of tasks
2.  A two day period will be communicated between both parties that will allow the contacted team member to show improvement in participation. If no improvement or desire to improve is seen, the remaining group members must agree to reach out to Professor Jean Salac to discuss further steps on how to handle the situation.
