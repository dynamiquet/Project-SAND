The dataset was designed and built by FEMA

By the Freedom of Information Act enacted in 1966, any person has a right of access to federal agency records. Therefore, the dataset is available to the public. 

### Meaningful User Interaction
- Those who want to be more weather-aware would be more likely to interact with the data. In general, it would be open for anyone, but it would mostly be targeted at those who want to learn more about natural disasters that are more common in a certain region

- They would interact with the data by inputting their desired county (level of locality may change), and then get a list of natural disasters that are common as well as links to government resources on how to prepare for specific natural disasters

- Although natural disasters happen all the time, not everyone knows what they are or how to prepare for them. By interacting with this data, the hope is that they become more conscientious about weather and hopefully take steps to be better prepared for when they do happen.
