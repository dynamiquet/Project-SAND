# **Project S.A.N.D (Spreading Awareness of Natural Disasters)**

### Dataset Summary

Our datasets is composed of natural disaster data collected by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) sorted by county. We will specifically target information on natural disaster frequency, location, type of disaster, and disaster hazard risk for each county. 

### Metadata

Data taken from FEMA

Name of dataset: All Counties - County-level detail (Table)

URL: https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources#csvDownload

Downloaded on January 17, 2025

The dataset was designed and built by FEMA

By the Freedom of Information Act enacted in 1966, any person has a right of access to federal agency records. Therefore, the dataset is available to the public. 

### Meaningful User Interaction

1. **Search Bar for County-Specific Data**
   - Potential Users: Those who want to be more weather-aware would be more likely to interact with the data. In general, it would be open for anyone, but it would mostly be targeted at those who want to learn more about natural disasters that are more common in their county

   - Interaction Mechanism: They would interact with the data by inputting their desired county (level of locality may change), and then get a list of natural disasters that are common as well as links to government resources on how to prepare for specific natural disasters

   - Potential Benefits: Although natural disasters happen all the time, not everyone knows what they are or how to prepare for them. By interacting with this data, the hope is that they become more conscientious about weather and hopefully take steps to be better prepared for when they do happen.

   - Potential Risks: Users outside of the US would feel excluded because the data contains every county in the US. The website would only be beneficial for someone who is living within the US. On a more indirect note, those who don't interact with the website could potentially be harmed by a disaster if they are not informed about them. Although a bit more extreme, it could be a possibility. 

2. **Drop-Down menu for Specifc Natural Disasters**
   - Potential Users: Users who have searched for their county would now be presented with a sorted list of natural disasters most prevelant in their county. They would click on a given disaster to learn more about it.

   - Interaction Mechanism: A dropdown menu for a specific disaster detailing hazard risk, frequency, and hyperlinks to information on how to prepare for the given disaster.

   - Potential Benefits: Instead of having so much information thrown at a users face, the user can click on a disaster they want to learn more about and get quick concise information on it. Disasters with a higher hazrd risk are shown first.

   - Potential Risks: The list being sorted in descending order of hazard risk can create the possibility that a user ignores disasters at the bottom of the list. This may leave them uninformed for the disaster if it occurs.

3. **Search Bar for Natural Disasters**
   - Potential Users: Users who would rather want general information on a natural disaster without having to search a county would use this search bar.

   - Interaction Mechanism: A search bar exclusively for natural disasters.

   - Potential Benefits: A user wants direct access to information on a natural disaster will benefit from such a user interaction.

   - Potential Risks: Users might assume the information applies uniformly to all areas, missing crucial regional-specific details about the disaster
